jsFace is a framework to facilitate Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
in JavaScript. It is designed to work on both server and client side JavaScript.

jsFace has some cool features like method overloading, type checking, Aspect
Oriented Programming (AOP), and profiling. It came out when I developed an ExtJS-liked
UI framework using jQuery.

To see how jsFace was designed and works. Take a look on the [[Wiki|https://github.com/tannhu/jsface/wiki]] page.
